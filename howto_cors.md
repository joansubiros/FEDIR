# CORS configuration for FileMaker Server OData

## Problem

The web viewer page is served from `http://192.168.0.x:8080` (a LAN machine
running nginx), while the OData API lives at `https://***servidor***/fmi/odata/v4/`.
This is a **cross-origin** request (different host, different protocol, different
port), so the browser enforces CORS.

Symptoms in the web viewer console:

```text
Preflight response is not successful. Status code: 405
Fetch API cannot load https://fms.adsretail.net/fmi/odata/v4/... due to access control checks.
```

Root causes on the FileMaker Server Apache config:

1. No `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header was being sent for OData requests.
2. The only CORS header present pointed at the server's internal hostname
   (`***hostname***`), not the browser's origin.
3. Apache returned `405 Method Not Allowed` for `OPTIONS` preflight requests.

## Solution

Add a CORS policy inside the `<Location "/fmi">` block in FileMaker Server's
Apache config that:

- Reflects the browser's `Origin` header back as `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`
  (only for trusted LAN origins).
- Allows the request headers and methods used by `fms-odata-js`.
- Returns `200` for `OPTIONS` preflight requests.
- Removes the old global CORS headers that conflicted with the new policy.

## Which config file to edit

FileMaker Server on macOS keeps two config files in
`/Library/FileMaker Server/HTTPServer/conf/`:

| File | Role |
| ---- | ---- |
| `httpd.conf.2.4` | Source config. Edited by the admin. |
| `httpd.conf` | The file FMS's Apache **actually loads** when HTTP/2 is **off** (the default). |

The `Enable_HTTP2.sh` script (in `/Library/FileMaker Server/HTTPServer/`)
determines which file is loaded:

- **HTTP/2 off (default)**: `httpdctl` runs `patch_mod_mpm`, which takes
  `httpd.conf.2.4`, patches the MPM module lines, and writes the result as
  `httpd.conf`. FMS loads `httpd.conf`.
- **HTTP/2 on** (after running the script): `patch_mod_mpm` is commented out,
  so `httpd.conf.2.4` is loaded directly.

Check which protocol is active:

```bash
curl -I -k --http2 https://localhost/fmi/webd 2>/dev/null | grep HTTP
```

- `HTTP/2`  → edit `httpd.conf.2.4` (loaded directly).
- `HTTP/1.1` → edit `httpd.conf` (the generated file FMS loads). Also apply
  the same edits to `httpd.conf.2.4` so they stay in sync.

> **Note**: In practice, `httpd.conf` is **not** always regenerated from
> `httpd.conf.2.4` on every restart. Treat both as standalone files and keep
> them in sync manually.

## Edits

### Edit 1 — Replace the `<Location "/fmi">` block

Find the existing `<Location "/fmi">` block and replace its contents with:

```apache
<Location "/fmi">
    Header set X-Content-Type-Options nosniff

    # Set cookie expiration date (12 hours in seconds), path and httponly
    Header edit Set-Cookie ^(.*(JSESSIONID).*)$ $1;Max-Age=43200

    # CORS configuration for 192.168.0.* range (with optional port)
    RewriteEngine On
    RewriteCond %{HTTP:Origin} ^http://192\.168\.0\.[0-9]{1,3}(:[0-9]+)?$ [NC]
    RewriteRule ^ - [E=ALLOW_ORIGIN:%{HTTP:Origin}]

    Header always set Access-Control-Allow-Origin "%{ALLOW_ORIGIN}e" env=ALLOW_ORIGIN
    Header always set Access-Control-Allow-Headers "Origin, X-Requested-With, Content-Type, Accept, Authorization, odata-maxversion, odata-version, Prefer, OData-MaxVersion, OData-Version"
    Header always set Access-Control-Allow-Methods "PATCH, GET, POST, DELETE, OPTIONS"
    Header always set Access-Control-Allow-Credentials "true"

    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_METHOD} OPTIONS
    RewriteRule ^ - [R=200,L]

</Location>
```

Key details:

- The `RewriteCond` regex **must allow the port** (`(:[0-9]+)?`). The browser
  sends the Origin with the port (e.g. `http://***localip***:8080`). Without
  this, the env var is never set and `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` is omitted.
- `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` is a **response** header and must **not**
  appear in `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` (it is not a request header).
- `Accept` must be in `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` because `fms-odata-js`
  sends an `Accept` header.
- `fms-odata-js` also sends OData-specific headers (`odata-maxversion`,
  `odata-version`, `Prefer`, and capitalized variants). All of these must be
  in `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` or the browser rejects the preflight.
  Alternatively, use `"*"` for Allow-Headers (safe even with credentials,
  unlike Allow-Origin).
- `RewriteRule ^ - [R=200,L]` returns `200` with an empty body for `OPTIONS`.
  Do **not** use `RewriteRule ^(.*)$ $1 [R=200,L]` — it produces a malformed
  response.

### Edit 2 — Remove the old global CORS headers

Find these lines (outside the `<Location>` block, further down in the file)
and **delete or comment them out**:

```apache
# Add headers for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policies
Header set Access-Control-Allow-Origin ${SERVER_NAME}
Header set Access-Control-Allow-Headers "Content-Type, Authorization"
Header set Access-Control-Allow-Credentials "true"
```

These set `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` to `${SERVER_NAME}` (the server's
internal hostname, e.g. `NBCNSERVER01.local`), which conflicts with the
per-origin policy in the `<Location>` block.

### Edit 3 (optional) — Suppress the startup warning

Find:

```apache
ServerName "${SERVER_NAME}"
```

Replace with:

```apache
ServerName fms.adsretail.net
```

This silences the `AH00558: Could not reliably determine the server's fully
qualified domain name` warning on startup.

## Apply and restart

`fmsadmin restart wpe` only restarts the Web Publishing Engine, **not**
Apache. A full FMS restart is required to reload `httpd.conf`:

```bash
# Validate config syntax first
httpd -t

# Full FMS restart (restarts Apache + all FMS processes)
sudo launchctl stop com.filemaker.fms
sudo launchctl start com.filemaker.fms
```

Wait ~10 seconds for FMS to fully start.

## Verify

```bash
curl -ksS -X OPTIONS \
  -H "Origin: http://***localip***:8080" \
  -H "Access-Control-Request-Method: GET" \
  -H "Access-Control-Request-Headers: authorization" \
  -D - -o /dev/null \
  "https://***url***/fmi/odata/v4/YourDatabase/Contacts"
```

Expected response headers:

```text
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://***localip***:8080
Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Origin, X-Requested-With, Content-Type, Accept, Authorization, odata-maxversion, odata-version, Prefer, OData-MaxVersion, OData-Version
Access-Control-Allow-Methods: PATCH, GET, POST, DELETE, OPTIONS
Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
```

If `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` is missing or the Allow-Headers still shows
the old value, the config wasn't reloaded — do the full `launchctl` restart,
not just `fmsadmin restart wpe`.

## Troubleshooting

### Edits not taking effect

1. Confirm the edits are in the file FMS actually loads (see "Which config
   file to edit" above).
2. Use `sudo launchctl stop/start com.filemaker.fms`, **not** `fmsadmin
   restart wpe`.
3. Check for overriding `Include` files:

   ```bash
   grep -rn "Access-Control-Allow" '/Library/FileMaker Server/HTTPServer/conf/extra/'
   ```

### Still getting 405 on preflight

The `OPTIONS` RewriteRule isn't firing. Verify `mod_rewrite` is loaded
(`LoadModule rewrite_module`) and that `RewriteEngine On` is inside the
`<Location>` block.

### `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header missing

The `ALLOW_ORIGIN` env var isn't being set. Check that the `RewriteCond`
regex matches the actual Origin header the browser sends (including the
port). For a quick test, hardcode the origin instead of using the env var:

```apache
Header always set Access-Control-Allow-Origin "http://***localip***:8080"
```

## Security notes

- The `RewriteCond` allows **any** `192.168.0.x` origin. This is fine for a
  trusted LAN. To lock it down, replace the regex with the specific IP(s).
- `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true` combined with a reflected origin
  means the browser sends cookies/auth with cross-origin requests. This is
  required for OData Basic auth but should not be used with `Access-Control-
  Allow-Origin: *`.
- FMS may overwrite `httpd.conf` on a future update/reinstall. Reapply the
  edits if that happens, and keep `httpd.conf.2.4` in sync as a backup.
